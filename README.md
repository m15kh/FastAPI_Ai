# FastAPI for AI Model Development

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python. It is particularly well-suited for serving AI models due to its asynchronous capabilities and ease of use.

## Example: Connecting a Large Language Model (LLM) with FastAPI

Below is an example of how you can use FastAPI to serve an LLM model:

1. Load your AI model (e.g., an LLM) using a library like `transformers`.
2. Create FastAPI endpoints to interact with the model.
3. Deploy the FastAPI app to make the model accessible.


### Visual Representation

The following diagram illustrates the connection between FastAPI and an LLM model:

This setup allows you to send requests to the FastAPI app, which processes the input and returns the model's response.
